        <h2>Description</h2>

		<p>Dig Dug is a 1-2 player arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your
			way through the earth. Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called Pooka
			and Fygar, who will continually chase you around. The only weapon that you carry is
			an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode.

            This definitely goes under the heading of "Games That Were Made While a Programmer 
			Was on Drugs," or at least had a good imagination. And maybe they were into horror
			movies too.
