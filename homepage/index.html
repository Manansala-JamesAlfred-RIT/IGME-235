            Welcome to my homepage for 235! I'm a 2nd year RIT student majoring in Game Design & Development, and I aspire to be the best I can be with whatever is thrown my way. I grew up in an environment where gaming was acknowledged as more than a hobby, but as an artistic form of expression and humanity. At RIT, I strive to meet the challenge, even if I may be stubborn to never refuse it. Everyone's got their ups and downs, and I feel we should all come to be more sensible to that notion- starting with me. I hope to ultimately prove that I have what it takes to ultimately create something that makes the world a more empathetic place.
